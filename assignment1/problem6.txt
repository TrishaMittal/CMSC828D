/* 
When we tried executing this query, we got the following error.
ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "carriers_pkey"
DETAIL:  Key (cid)=(02Q) already exists.
SQL state: 23505
We were expecting this because, given cid is a Primary Key for the table Carriers, no duplicate entry would be allowed for that attribute. And we know that this cid '02Q' already exists in the table Carriers.

When we tried inserting these set of values, where the carrier_id 'TEST' doesn't exist in the Carriers relation we got the following error. 
ERROR:  insert or update on table "flights" violates foreign key constraint "flights_constraint"
DETAIL:  Key (carrier_id)=(Test) is not present in table "carriers".
SQL state: 23503
We were expecting the following error, as we have applied FOREIGN KEY contraints such that Flights.carrier_id references Carriers.cid. 
Given we try to insert an entry with a carrier_id not existing in the Carriers table, it results in defying the Referential Integrity Constraints. 
Had these PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints not been present in the tables, we would have been able to add the two tuples in the respective tables.

When we tried deleting the entry in Carriers corresponding to cid 'AA', it ran into the following error.
ERROR:  update or delete on table "carriers" violates foreign key constraint "flights_constraint" on table "flights"
DETAIL:  Key (cid)=(AA) is still referenced from table "flights".
SQL state: 23503
We were once again expecting this result as its trying to break the referential integrity constraints. As the Flights carrier_id references the cid in Carriers realtion, we will have to delete the tuples corresponding to 'AA' in Flights before running this query.
