For this assignment,

1. We seperately went through the assignments and did the postgres installation.
2. For the first 3 questions, just so both of us could get used to postgres, we worked seperately.
3. For questions 4, 6 and 8, we sat together and worked out queries and and then discussed and came up with the most optimal answers.

After completing this assignment we both feel comfortable working with SQL queries, creating views and understanding the importances of the Integrity constraints.
